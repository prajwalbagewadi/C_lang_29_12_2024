Companies like Microsoft, Adobe, IBM, NASA, and many embedded systems manufacturers heavily utilize C programming language because of its efficiency, direct hardware control, and suitability for low-level system development, particularly in areas like operating systems, device drivers, and applications where performance and resource management are critical.

Key reasons why companies use C:
Direct Hardware Access:
C allows for precise control over hardware components, making it ideal for embedded systems where tight integration with hardware is necessary.

High Performance:
C code is typically compiled to highly optimized machine code, resulting in excellent execution speed crucial for performance-critical applications.

Portability:
C code can be relatively easily ported across different platforms with minimal changes, allowing developers to reuse code across diverse hardware architectures.

Mature Ecosystem:
C has been around for a long time, leading to a vast library of existing code and tools readily available for developers to leverage.
Specific examples of C usage in companies:

Microsoft Windows Kernel:
A large portion of the Windows operating system kernel is written in C due to its low-level control needs.
Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator:
Core functionalities of these design software are built using C for optimal performance.

Embedded Systems:
Companies developing devices like smartwatches, routers, and industrial controllers often use C for their embedded software due to its hardware-near capabilities.

NASA Spacecraft Software:
C is frequently used in critical space systems due to its reliability and ability to manage resource constraints.
